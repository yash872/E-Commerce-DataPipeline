# E-Commerce-DataPipeline

## Project Overview
This Project is an overview of an E-Commerce Data Pipeline which involves building a sophisticated event-driven data ingestion and transformation pipeline focusing on e-commerce transactional data.
We will design a system using AWS services such as S3, Lambda, Glue, Redshift, and SNS to ingest, transform, validate, and upsert data into Amazon Redshift for analytical purposes.
